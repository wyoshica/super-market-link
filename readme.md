## About SuperMarket
Astra Market first opened its doors in April 2023, but just three months later it relaunched as SuperMarket with a new focus on becoming one of the most user-friendly and feature-rich darknet markets out there. It's got all the usual features, like walletless pay, but you can also make a purchase without registering for an account. You can still communicate with the vendor, raise disputes and even post reviews. It's the first platform to offer these features since Monopoly Market. All payments are in Monero (XMR) for extra security. There's also a big focus on harm reduction, with a whole section of the market dedicated to it. Vendors are really encouraged to follow good harm reduction practices.

### Registration / Login process:

Registering for an account on SuperMarket is 'super' easy. Simply choose a username and password, then complete the captcha, and you're good to go.
But wait a minute! Supermarket lets you browse the market without an account, and it's one of only a few markets that lets you make purchases without an account. So if you're really security conscious and don't like the idea of registering for anything, or just want the quickest experience possible, SuperMarket offers you an alternative. Just a heads-up: there are a few features you won't be able to access. As you'd expect, registration (plus PGP 2-FA) is mandatory for vendors.
